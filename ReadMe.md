# Office 365 Connect Sample for iOS Using the Microsoft Graph SDK

Microsoft Graph is a unified endpoint for accessing data, relationships and insights that come from the Microsoft Cloud. This sample shows how to connect and authenticate to it, and then call mail and user APIs through the [Microsoft Graph SDK for iOS](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-sdk-ios).

> Note: Try out the [Microsoft Graph App Registration Portal](https://graph.microsoft.io/en-us/app-registration) page which simplifies registration so you can get this sample running faster.
 
## Prerequisites
* [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/) from Apple -This sample is currently tested and supported on version 8.2.1 of Xcode.
* Installation of [CocoaPods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/using-cocoapods.html)  as a dependency manager.
* A Microsoft work or personal email account such as Office 365, or outlook.com, hotmail.com, etc. You can sign up for [an Office 365 Developer subscription](https://aka.ms/devprogramsignup) that includes the resources that you need to start building Office 365 apps.

     > Note: If you already have a subscription, the previous link sends you to a page with the message *Sorry, you canâ€™t add that to your current account*. In that case, use an account from your current Office 365 subscription.    
* A client id from the registered app at [Microsoft Graph App Registration Portal](https://graph.microsoft.io/en-us/app-registration)
* To make requests, an **MSAuthenticationProvider** must be provided which is capable of authenticating HTTPS requests with an appropriate OAuth 2.0 bearer token. We will be using [msgraph-sdk-ios-nxoauth2-adapter](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-sdk-ios-nxoauth2-adapter) for a sample implementation of MSAuthenticationProvider that can be used to jump-start your project. See the below section **Code of Interest** for more information.

>**Note:** The sample was tested on Xcode 8.2.1. This sample supports Xcode 8 and iOS10, which uses the Swift 3.0 framework.
       
## Running this sample in Xcode

1. Clone this repository
2. Use CocoaPods to import the Microsoft Graph SDK and authentication dependencies:
        
		pod 'MSGraphSDK'
		pod 'MSGraphSDK-NXOAuth2Adapter'


 This sample app already contains a podfile that will get the pods into  the project. Simply navigate to the project From **Terminal** and run: 
        
        pod install
        
   For more information, see **Using CocoaPods** in [Additional Resources](#AdditionalResources)
  
3. Open **Graph-iOS-Swift-Connect.xcworkspace**
4. Open **AutheticationConstants.swift** under Application folder. You'll see that the **clientId** from the registration process can be added to this file.

   ```swift
        static let clientId = "ENTER_YOUR_CLIENT_ID"
   ```    
    > Note: You'll notice that the following permission scopes have been configured for this project: **"https://graph.microsoft.com/Mail.Send", "https://graph.microsoft.com/User.Read", "offline_access"**. The service calls used in this project, sending a mail to your mail account and retriving some profile information (Display Name, Email Address) require these permissions for the app to run properly.


5. Run the sample. You'll be asked to connect/authenticate to a work or personal mail account, and then you can send a mail to that account, or to another selected email account.


## Code of Interest

All authentication code can be viewed in the **Authentication.swift** file. We use a sample implementation of MSAuthenticationProvider extended from [NXOAuth2Client](https://github.com/nxtbgthng/OAuth2Client) to provide login support for registered native apps, automatic refreshing of access tokens, and logout functionality:

### Authenticate the user

```swift
        // Set client ID
        NXOAuth2AuthenticationProvider.setClientId(clientId, scopes: scopes)
        
        // Try silent log in. This will attempt to sign in if there is a previous successful
        // sign in user information.
        if NXOAuth2AuthenticationProvider.sharedAuth().loginSilent() == true {
            completion(nil)
        }
        // Otherwise, present log in controller.
        else {
            NXOAuth2AuthenticationProvider.sharedAuth()
                .login(with: nil) { (error: Error?) in
                    
                    if let nserror = error {
                        completion(MSGraphError.nsErrorType(error: nserror as NSError))
                    }
                    else {
                        completion(nil)
                    }
            }
        }
    ...
    
    func disconnect() {
        NXOAuth2AuthenticationProvider.sharedAuth().logout()
    }

```
Once the authentication provider is set, we can create and initialize a client object (MSGraphClient) that will be used to make calls against the Microsoft Graph service endpoint (mail and users). In **SendViewcontroller.swift** we can assemble a mail request and send it using the following code:

### Get user profile picture

```swift
        self.graphClient.me().photoValue().download {
            (url: URL?, response: URLResponse?, error: Error?) in
            
                guard let picUrl = url else {
                    return
                }
            
                let picData = NSData(contentsOf: picUrl)
                let picImage = UIImage(data: picData! as Data)
            
                if let validPic = picImage {
                    completion(.success(validPic))
                }
            }

```
### Upload the picture to OneDrive

```swift
        let data = UIImageJPEGRepresentation(unwrappedImage, 1.0)
        self.graphClient
            .me()
            .drive()
            .root()
            .children()
            .driveItem("me.png")
            .contentRequest()
            .upload(from: data, completion: {
                (driveItem: MSGraphDriveItem?, error: Error?) in
                if let nsError = error {
                    return
                } else {
                    webUrl = (driveItem?.webUrl)!
                }
            })

```

### Attach the picture to a new email message

```swift
            let fileAttachment = MSGraphFileAttachment()
            let data = UIImageJPEGRepresentation(unwrappedImage, 1.0)
            fileAttachment.contentType = "image/png"
            fileAttachment.oDataType = "#microsoft.graph.fileAttachment"
            fileAttachment.contentBytes = data?.base64EncodedString()
            fileAttachment.name = "me.png"
            message.attachments.append(fileAttachment)

```

### Send the message

```swift
    let requestBuilder = graphClient.me().sendMail(with: message, saveToSentItems: false)
    let mailRequest = requestBuilder?.request()
            
        mailRequest?.execute(completion: {
            (response: [AnyHashable: Any]?, error: Error?) in
            if let nsError = error {
                print(NSLocalizedString("ERROR", comment: ""), nsError.localizedDescription)
                DispatchQueue.main.async(execute: {
                    self.statusTextView.text = NSLocalizedString("SEND_FAILURE", comment: "")
                })
                    
            }

...            

```
